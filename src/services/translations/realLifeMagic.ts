    "rlm.faq.a1": "Even minimal in‑person contact confers significant benefits. Seeing one close friend regularly delivers many protective effects; diverse networks provide the strongest gains.",
    "rlm.faq.q2": "Can video calls substitute for in‑person interaction?",
    "rlm.faq.a2": "Video calls help and are superior to text, but they lack key sensory information—like scent, subtle body language, and shared spatial context—necessary for deep bonding.",
    "rlm.faq.q3": "Do introverts benefit as much as extraverts?",
    "rlm.faq.a3": "Yes. Quality over quantity. Many introverts prefer smaller groups or one‑on‑one time and still achieve full health gains from meaningful, regular contact.",
    "rlm.faq.q4": "Which ages benefit most?",
    "rlm.faq.a4": "Benefits apply across the lifespan; effects are pronounced for older adults and during developmental windows for youth. Some studies estimate social connection slows biological aging by 1–2 years in older adults.",
    "rlm.faq.q5": "Are group adventures better than routine hangouts?",
    "rlm.faq.a5": "Novel, challenging experiences reliably forge stronger bonds than routine meetups, via dopamine/endorphin responses and shared arousal linked to companions.",
    "rlm.faq.q6": "What's the minimum group size?",
    "rlm.faq.a6": "Two people suffice for many benefits. For adventures, groups of ~6–10 often maximize participation, cohesion, and memory effects.",
    "rlm.faq.q7": "Do workplace relationships count?",
    "rlm.faq.a7": "Meaningful workplace ties matter—especially when they extend beyond tasks to mutual support and informal connection.",
    "rlm.faq.q8": "How quickly can I feel better?",

    "rlm.intro.p1": "¿Y si hubiera una sola intervención que pudiera mejorar las probabilidades de supervivencia en un 50%, fortalecer tu sistema inmunitario como dejar de fumar e incluso hacer que la comida sepa mejor? No es un fármaco nuevo—es la magia comprobada científicamente de la conexión humana significativa, cara a cara.",
    "rlm.intro.p2.part1": "En un mundo saturado de contacto digital, enfrentamos una paradoja: niveles récord de soledad y sus consecuencias. La OMS estima que la soledad contribuye a 871.000 muertes anuales—unas 100 cada hora.",
    "rlm.intro.p2.link": "Informe sobre la Epidemia de Soledad",
    "rlm.intro.p2.part2": "¿La otra cara? Las relaciones cara a cara son una de las intervenciones más potentes para el florecimiento humano.",
    "rlm.intro.info": "Las diferencias en riesgo de mortalidad asociadas con el aislamiento social frente a la conexión son contundentes: las relaciones sólidas se vinculan con hasta un 50% menos de riesgo de mortalidad por todas las causas. Explora el contexto completo en la Epidemia de Soledad.",
    "rlm.intro.p3": "Desde las cascadas neuroquímicas que inundan el cerebro durante encuentros auténticos hasta cambios inmunitarios medibles tras actividades grupales, la ciencia muestra que las interacciones reales reconfiguran circuitos neuronales, regulan el estrés y prolongan la vida. Esta guía destila esos hallazgos y muestra cómo aprovecharlos.",

    "rlm.meals.heading": "Comidas compartidas: por qué la comida sabe mejor con amigos",
    "rlm.meals.p1": "Uno de los hallazgos más encantadores de la neurociencia social: la comida puede literalmente saber mejor juntos. Varios estudios muestran que el contexto social altera la percepción del sabor de manera medible.",
    "rlm.meals.sub1": "El descubrimiento del umbral eléctrico del gusto",
    "rlm.meals.sub1.p": "Comer con amigos cercanos disminuyó los umbrales eléctricos del gusto ~9%. Refleja un cambio fisiológico en la sensibilidad sensorial y aparece con compañeros familiares, coherente con la activación parasimpática.",
    "rlm.meals.sub2": "La lógica evolutiva de comer en grupo",
    "rlm.meals.sub2.p": "Las comidas compartidas ayudaron a evaluar seguridad de alimentos, distribuir recursos y fortalecer vínculos—rituales visibles hoy. La gente es ~50% más propensa a probar nuevos alimentos en grupo que sola.",

    "rlm.group.sub1": "El amplificador de la aventura compartida",
    "rlm.group.sub1.p": "Las experiencias nuevas y desafiantes crean recuerdos más fuertes y conexiones más profundas cuando se comparten. Las vías de recompensa se activan más en contextos sociales.",
    "rlm.group.sub2": "La bioquímica del desafío compartido",
    "rlm.group.sub2.p": "El desafío físico aumenta endorfinas; la novedad y el estrés controlado activan dopamina. En grupo, las señales se asocian con los compañeros, fortaleciendo vínculos más allá de lo habitual.",
    "rlm.group.p_end": "Los entrenamientos en grupo mejoran tolerancia al dolor, rendimiento y conexión mediante esfuerzo sincronizado y desafío compartido.",

    "rlm.social.sub1": "La gran desconexión",
    "rlm.social.sub1.p": "Putnam documentó décadas de descenso en la participación cívica en EE. UU.—de clubes y sindicatos a PTA, asistencia religiosa, voluntariado y vecindad. Señaló tiempo de pantalla, suburbanización, presiones de tiempo y recambio generacional.",
    "rlm.social.sub2": "Hallazgos clave",
    "rlm.social.sub2.p": "El capital social se vincula a menor crimen, mejor salud, mayor educación y economías locales más fuertes—pero han caído las ligas, membresías y reuniones públicas desde mediados del siglo XX.",
    "rlm.social.sub3": "Unión vs puente",
    "rlm.social.sub3.p": "La unión es cerrada y homófila; el puente cruza diferencias. Las comunidades sanas cultivan ambos; el puente es crucial para resiliencia, innovación y flujo de oportunidades.",
    "rlm.social.sub4": "A la era digital",
    "rlm.social.sub4.p": "Algunas comunidades digitales sustituyen o complementan vínculos presenciales, pero muchas interacciones siguen siendo más delgadas que las co‑presentes. Grupos basados en actividades convierten intereses en lazos presenciales recurrentes.",

    "rlm.faq.q2": "¿Las videollamadas sustituyen lo presencial?",
    "rlm.faq.a2": "Ayudan y superan al texto, pero carecen de información sensorial clave—como olor, lenguaje corporal sutil y contexto espacial compartido—necesaria para vínculos profundos.",
    "rlm.faq.q3": "¿Los introvertidos se benefician tanto como los extrovertidos?",
    "rlm.faq.a3": "Sí. Calidad sobre cantidad. Muchos introvertidos prefieren grupos pequeños o uno a uno y logran beneficios completos con contacto significativo y regular.",
    "rlm.faq.q4": "¿Qué edades se benefician más?",
    "rlm.faq.a4": "En toda la vida; efectos marcados en mayores y en ventanas de desarrollo en jóvenes. Algunas estimaciones indican enlentecimiento del envejecimiento biológico 1–2 años en mayores.",
    "rlm.faq.q5": "¿Las aventuras en grupo superan a los planes rutinarios?",
    "rlm.faq.a5": "Las experiencias novedosas y desafiantes forjan vínculos más fuertes que las reuniones rutinarias, vía dopamina/endorfinas y activación compartida.",
    "rlm.faq.q6": "¿Tamaño mínimo de grupo?",
    "rlm.faq.a6": "Dos personas bastan para muchos beneficios. Para aventuras, grupos de ~6–10 suelen maximizar participación, cohesión y memoria.",
    "rlm.faq.q7": "¿Cuentan las relaciones laborales?",
    "rlm.faq.a7": "Sí, especialmente cuando trascienden tareas hacia apoyo mutuo y conexión informal.",
    "rlm.faq.q8": "¿Qué tan rápido puedo sentirme mejor?",

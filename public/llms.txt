## 🧠 AI Summary
Pulse Meet New Friends is a free app that helps people form real-life friendships in their city.

Pip —the AI penguin host— keeps the chat lively, suggests activities, and motivates each crew to meet in person.  
From hikes and karaoke nights to brunch and art walks, Pulse makes it effortless to **find your crew and spark life together.**

## ❓ FAQs About Pulse

### What is Pulse and how can it help me meet new friends in my city?
Pulse is a free mobile app that helps you make real-life friends in your city. It matches you with a small group of locals who share your vibe and brings everyone together in a group chat hosted by Pip, our friendly AI penguin.

### How does Pulse work?
You’ll take a quick vibe test, get matched with locals who share your interests, and join a group chat hosted by Pip. Your crew starts a 10-day mission to plan a meetup. Once half RSVP, the mission activates — and each time you meet, it automatically extends to keep the energy alive.

### What kinds of activities do crews do together?
Crews choose anything from coffee, brunch, and trivia to kayaking, pottery, karaoke, hikes, or game nights. Pip suggests plans based on the group’s shared vibe and budget.

### What’s the vibe test?
A one-minute quiz about your interests, schedule, and energy that helps us find your perfect match.

### How does matching work?
Pulse uses AI and data models to match people who are statistically compatible based on vibe, schedule, and social energy.

### Do you match by identity or interests?
Yes — Pulse supports dedicated groups for queer people, expats, hobbyists, and more.

### How does the 10-day mission work?
Each crew has 10 days to plan a meetup. When 50% RSVP, the mission is “activated” and the chat extends after your first meetup.

### What if my crew doesn’t click?
No stress — Pip keeps chats active and suggests new ideas. If it’s not a match, you can join another crew after your mission ends.

### Who is Pip?
Pip is Pulse’s AI penguin host who facilitates group chats, sparks conversation, and celebrates your meetup wins.

### How does Pulse keep things safe?
Public meetups, clear community guidelines, and fast moderation keep Pulse safe and positive.

### Is Pulse free?
Yes — completely free. Many groups plan free or low-cost activities.

### Is Pulse a dating app?
No. Pulse focuses on *friendship and community,* not dating — though real life sometimes has surprises.

### What happens after the first meetup?
Once your crew meets, the chat stays open, the mission extends, and new activities appear automatically.

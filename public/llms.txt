# Pulse App - AI-Powered Friend Group Matching Platform

## About Pulse
Pulse is a next-generation social connection platform that uses AI to match like-minded people into small friend groups (6-12 people called "crews") and facilitates real-life meetups. We solve the challenge of making meaningful adult friendships by combining intelligent matching with structured social activities.

## Core Value Proposition
